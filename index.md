# sojkaware

Welcome to the official developer page for **sojkaware**. I focus on creating privacy-first, local-first utility applications for Android.

## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to all applications developed by **sojkaware** (the "Apps").

### 1. Data Collection and Usage
**sojkaware** apps are designed with a "Privacy by Design" philosophy. 
- **No Personal Data Collection:** Our apps do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, such as your name, email address, location, or contacts.
- **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics or tracking tools.
- **Local Processing:** All data processing, file management, and synchronization happen strictly on your local device or within your private local network (WiFi). No data is ever sent to a remote server controlled by the developer.

### 2. Permissions
Our apps may request specific permissions to function. Here is how they are used:
- **Storage (All Files Access):** Used strictly to manage, back up, or serve files as requested by the user.
- **Network/WiFi:** Used to facilitate local communication between your devices (e.g., WebDAV server or mDNS discovery).
- **Foreground Service:** Used to ensure that long-running tasks (like file transfers) are not interrupted by the system.

### 3. Third-Party Services
Our apps do not integrate with third-party advertising networks or data brokers.

## Data Safety (Google Play)

For all apps by **sojkaware**:
- **Data Shared:** None. No data is shared with third parties.
- **Data Collected:** None. No data is collected by the developer.
- **Security Practices:** Data is handled locally using standard Android security protocols.
